At Samsung Electronics, employees could use simple commands like `go/knox` in any browser to instantly access the Knox security portal. I found it very handy, so I decided to make a similar thing for Linux users. Golink transforms this concept into a powerful command-line tool accessible right from your own computer.

Golink leverages the simplicity of command-line shortcuts to enhance your digital interactions, making web browsing faster and more responsive to your needs.
