      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.deepseek.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreffer &#34;&gt;DeepSeek&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s latest moves have sent ripples through the AI community. Not only has it marked the beginning of a new era in artificial intelligence, but it has also made significant contributions to the open-source AI landscape. Their engineering techniques behind DeepSeek are truly impressive, and their reports are quite enjoyable. However, understanding their core ideas can be challenging and demands a substantial amount of effort.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the forefront of this innovation is DeepSeek-R1, a model that built upon the foundation established by preceding projects such as DeepSeek Coder, Math, MoE, and notably, the DeepSeek-V3 model. While DeepSeek-R1 is the center of the DeepSeek&amp;rsquo;s frenzy, its success is rooted on these past works.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
