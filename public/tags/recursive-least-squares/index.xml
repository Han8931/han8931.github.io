<h2 id="introduction-to-recursive-least-squares">Introduction to Recursive Least Squares</h2>
<p>Ordinary least squares assumes that all data is available at once, but in practice, this isn&rsquo;t always the case. <strong>Often, measurements are obtained sequentially</strong>, and we need to update our estimates as new data comes in. Simply augmenting the data matrix $\mathbf{X}$ each time a new measurement arrives can become computationally expensive, especially when dealing with a large number of measurements. This is where <strong><em>Recursive Least Squares</em></strong> (RLS) comes into play.</p>]]></description>
