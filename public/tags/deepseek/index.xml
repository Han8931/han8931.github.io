    <description><![CDATA[<p>The recent developments surrounding DeepSeek have sent ripples through the AI community. Not only has it marked the beginning of a new era in artificial intelligence, but it has also made significant contributions to the open-source AI landscape. Their approaches and engineering techniques are impressive, and I really enjoyed reading their reports. However, I found that understanding their key ideas required a substantial amount of effort.</p>
<p>The DeepSeek&rsquo;s</p>
<p>To help general readers navigate DeepSeekâ€™s innovations more easily, I decided to write this post as a gentle introduction to their key components. I hope that this will provide a clear and accessible explanation of their major contributions. I strongly encourage you to read their reports in detail!</p>]]></description>
