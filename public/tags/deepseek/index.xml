&rsquo;s latest moves have sent ripples through the AI community. Not only has it marked the beginning of a new era in artificial intelligence, but it has also made significant contributions to the open-source AI landscape. Their engineering techniques behind DeepSeek are truly impressive, and their reports are quite enjoyable. However, understanding their core ideas can be challenging and demands a substantial amount of effort.</p>
<p>At the forefront of this innovation is DeepSeek-R1, a model that built upon the foundation established by preceding projects such as DeepSeek Coder, Math, MoE, and notably, the DeepSeek-V3 model. While DeepSeek-R1 is the center of the DeepSeek&rsquo;s frenzy, its success is rooted on these past works.</p>]]></description>
