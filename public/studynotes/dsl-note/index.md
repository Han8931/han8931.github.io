I started writing these notes during my **master’s degree** as a way to organize and clarify my understanding of **machine learning** and **deep learning**. Over time, the notes have grown into a comprehensive study resource that combines theoretical foundations with practical insights.

I enjoy organizing knowledge and writing things down, and these notes reflect that process — carefully breaking down concepts, connecting ideas, and recording them in a way that can be revisited and built upon.

The goal of this collection is to:
* ✨ **Build strong intuition** — explain mathematical ideas in clear, accessible language.
* 🧩 **Connect theory and practice** — link statistical concepts to modern deep learning methods.
* 📚 **Serve as a long-term reference** — a resource I can return to as my research and projects evolve.

The notes cover a range of topics including **probability and statistics, optimization methods, neural networks, and modern deep learning architectures**, along with worked examples and derivations.

> I welcome all comments and suggestions—and I'd be happy to improve and grow this note together with you.
