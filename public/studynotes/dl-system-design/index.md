This note is about the **practical design of deep learning and LLM-based systems**. It focuses on bridging research with production: covering concepts such as **scalable architectures, model deployment, monitoring, and system reliability**. The aim is to capture design patterns and lessons that make ML/DL services both effective and maintainable.

> I welcome all comments and suggestions—and I'd be happy to improve and grow this note together with you.
