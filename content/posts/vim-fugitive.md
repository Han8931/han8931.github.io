If you're working with Git and Vim, [**vim-fugitive**](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) is an essential plugin that transforms your editor into a full-fledged Git interface. Here's how I use Fugitive to review, stage, and commit changes‚Äîwithout ever leaving Vim.

## Browsing Git History and Logs First

Before jumping into edits, it‚Äôs often useful to understand the file‚Äôs history or recent project changes.

- `:Git log` ‚Äî shows the project‚Äôs commit history in reverse chronological order  
- `:0Gllog` ‚Äî shows the history of the current file

To explore who changed what in a file:

```vim
:Git blame
```

Press `<Enter>` on a line to inspect its commit, or press `g?` to see other commands.

## Viewing and Comparing Versions of a File

You might want to compare your current changes with previous versions:

- `:Gedit HEAD~2:%` ‚Äî opens the file as it was 2 commits ago  
- `:Gdiffsplit` ‚Äî shows the current file against the index (staged version)  
  - Use `:Gvdiffsplit` for vertical splits or `:Ghdiffsplit` for horizontal

In diff mode, use:
- `do` ‚Äî to obtain changes from the other pane  
- `dp` ‚Äî to put your changes into the other pane

---

## Making and Reviewing Changes

After edits, you may want to review your local changes:

```vim
:Gdiffsplit
```

This shows differences between the working copy and the staged version. Use this view to double-check before staging.

If you decide to undo your changes:

```vim
:Gread
```

This reverts the buffer to the version from the index or last commit.

---

## Staging and Preparing Commits

Now you‚Äôre ready to prepare your changes for commit:

```vim
:Git
```

This opens a status window with:
- Untracked files  
- Modified (unstaged) files  
- Staged files

You can:
- Press `-` to toggle staged/unstaged  
- Press `X` to discard changes  
- Press `dv`, `dh`, or `dd` to open diff views for review

When you‚Äôre satisfied, press:
- `cc` to commit staged changes  
- `ca` to amend the previous commit

You‚Äôll get a buffer to write your commit message. Save and close it to finish.

## Managing Files and Advanced Commands

Here are more powerful tools from Fugitive:

- `:Gwrite` ‚Äî stage the file (like `git add`)  
- `:GMove` / `:GRename` ‚Äî move or rename a file with Git  
- `:GDelete` / `:GRemove` ‚Äî remove a file and buffer  
- `:Ggrep`, `:Glgrep` ‚Äî grep across the repository  
- `:GBrowse` ‚Äî open the current file on GitHub or other providers

You can extend `:GBrowse` with plugins for:
- GitHub: [vim-rhubarb](https://github.com/tpope/vim-rhubarb)  
- GitLab: [fugitive-gitlab.vim](https://github.com/shumphrey/fugitive-gitlab.vim)  
- Others like Bitbucket, Azure DevOps, and Sourcehut

## Fugitive Cheat Sheet

Here are some quick facts and commands that make `vim-fugitive` incredibly powerful:

- `:Git` with no arguments opens a summary/status window for the current repo
- `:Gdiffsplit` or `:Gvdiffsplit` opens staged vs working tree versions for side-by-side diff
- `:Gread` reverts local changes (undo-able with `u`)
- `:Gwrite` stages the file (or updates it from history, depending on context)
- `:Git blame` opens interactive blame mode ‚Äî press `<Enter>` on a line to view its commit, or `g?` to see available options
- `:Gedit HEAD~3:%` opens the current file as it existed 3 commits ago
- `:Ggrep` and `:Glgrep` perform Git-powered searches within the repository

### File Management

- `:GMove` ‚Äî Perform a `git mv` on the file and rename the buffer
- `:GRename` ‚Äî Like `:GMove`, but destination is relative to current file
- `:GDelete` ‚Äî `git rm` + close buffer
- `:GRemove` ‚Äî `git rm` + keep buffer open

### Web Integration

Use `:GBrowse` to open the current file on your Git hosting provider. It even supports line ranges and works well in visual mode.

Plugins exist for:

- GitHub: [`vim-rhubarb`](https://github.com/tpope/vim-rhubarb)  
- GitLab: [`fugitive-gitlab.vim`](https://github.com/shumphrey/fugitive-gitlab.vim)  
- Bitbucket, Gitee, Azure DevOps, and others also supported.
