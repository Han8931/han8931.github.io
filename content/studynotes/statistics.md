# ðŸ“Š Statistics

ðŸ‘‰ Repository: [Statistics](https://github.com/Han8931/statistics)

This note collects my study materials on **probability and statistics**, with a focus on the foundations needed for **data science, machine learning, and deep learning**. It combines key definitions, derivations, and examples, aiming to make abstract ideas easier to understand and apply.
