# ðŸ“– Deep Statistical Learning

ðŸ‘‰ Full repository: [deep\_statistical\_learning](https://github.com/Han8931/deep_statistical_learning)

I started writing these notes during my **masterâ€™s degree** as a way to organize and clarify my understanding of **machine learning** and **deep learning**. Over time, the notes have grown into a comprehensive study resource that combines theoretical foundations with practical insights.

I enjoy organizing knowledge and writing things down, and these notes reflect that process â€” carefully breaking down concepts, connecting ideas, and recording them in a way that can be revisited and built upon.

The goal of this collection is to:
* âœ¨ **Build strong intuition** â€” explain mathematical ideas in clear, accessible language.
* ðŸ§© **Connect theory and practice** â€” link statistical concepts to modern deep learning methods.
* ðŸ“š **Serve as a long-term reference** â€” a resource I can return to as my research and projects evolve.

The notes cover a range of topics including **probability and statistics, optimization methods, neural networks, and modern deep learning architectures**, along with worked examples and derivations.
