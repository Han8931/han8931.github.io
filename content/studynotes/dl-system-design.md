# 🏗️ Deep Learning System Design

👉 Repository: [DL System Design](https://github.com/Han8931/dl_system_design)

This note is about the **practical design of deep learning and LLM-based systems**. It focuses on bridging research with production: covering concepts such as **scalable architectures, model deployment, monitoring, and system reliability**. The aim is to capture design patterns and lessons that make ML/DL services both effective and maintainable.
