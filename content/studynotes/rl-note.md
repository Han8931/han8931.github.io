# 📘 Reinforcement Learning Notes

👉 You can check out the full notes here: [reinforcement\_learning\_note](https://github.com/Han8931/reinforcement_learning_note)

There are already a number of excellent tutorials and lectures on **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, but I often find that many of them do not provide enough detail or explanation of the formulas behind the concepts. In many cases, key ideas are assumed to be *obvious* or *straightforward*—which can be a challenge for someone like me, who has a weaker background in mathematics but still wants a **comprehensive understanding** of RL.

To address this, I am writing these notes with the following goals:

✨ **Clarity over assumptions**
I attempt to explain the theory as clearly as possible, breaking down formulas with step-by-step reasoning and intuitive examples.

🧩 **Bridging theory and implementation**
Many Python RL implementations rely heavily on external libraries or are overly simplistic. My goal is to connect the **mathematical foundation** to **practical code**—without skipping over the details.

🙏 **Acknowledging the giants**
This work builds on numerous outstanding sources, and I am forever indebted to them for their contributions.
